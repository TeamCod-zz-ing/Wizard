****Class Descriptions*****

Entity:
	Location code:
		vars for x,y coords
		getters and setters for each
		up,down,left,right //These should call the getters and setters so we can bound check in one place

	Attribute code:
		hp
		mp
		etc.

Player:
	Attributes unique to the player
	Input? // I don't think so but possibly

Mob:
	Should contain AI code for monsters

Classes for unique monsters should extend mob, and implement their own characteristics
